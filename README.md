# WatchMyFile

##Developed by Devang Sharma

## Purpose
I developed a log watching solution similar to the "tail -f" UNIX command. Nonetheless, the file is here on a remote machine. 
The project is thus designed like the following:

1. A server side program which monitors the given file and streams its updates. It runs on the same machine as the log file and it uses WebSockets to be able to push the file updates to the client(s).

2. A web-based client that prints the updates of the file as they happen. Only the last 10 lines in the file are displayed when the page is loaded.

## Usage
This project is very simple to use, you only have to clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Devang-25/WatchLog.git && cd WatchLog```

Then, install the dependencies (websocket & mock-fs):

```npm install```

After that, run the server:

```npm run start```

*Optional* You can use the following python script (req. Python 3) to "randomly" log lines in your file:

```py randomlogger.py```

Finally, open your browser and go to the following url:

[http://localhost:8080/log](http://localhost:8080/log)

Now, you're able to **watch your logfile in your browser**.

## Caveats
This project has been tested with Node.js version 8.12.0 with the following browsers/OS:

* Firefox Quantum v63 on Windows 10
* Google Chrome v70 on Windows 10
* Firefox Quantum v62 on Fedora 28
* Google Chrome v69 on MacOS X

## Dependencies
* If you want to run the server in development mode (hot reload) you'll need to install `nodemon`
* If you want to run the unit tests, you'll have to install `mocha`
